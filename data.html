            <div id="hh1" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Adjust your day-to-day behaviors.
                <p>To reduce energy consumption in your home and increase your energy savings, you do not necessarily
                    need to go out and purchase energy efficient products. Energy conservation can be as simple as
                    turning off lights or appliances when you do not need them. You can also use energy-intensive
                    appliances less by performing household tasks manually, such as hang-drying your clothes instead of
                    putting them in the dryer, or washing dishes by hand.

                    The behavior adjustments that have the highest potential for utility savings are turning down the
                    heat on your thermostat in the winter and using your air conditioner less in the summer. Heating and
                    cooling costs constitute nearly half of an average home’s utility bills, so these reductions in the
                    intensity and frequency of heating and cooling offer the greatest savings.

                    There are tools you can use to figure out where most of your electricity is going in your home and
                    which appliances are using the most electricity on a day-to-day basis.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="hh2" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Replace your light bulbs.
                <p>Traditional incandescent light bulbs consume an excessive amount of electricity and must be replaced
                    more often than their energy efficient alternatives. Halogen incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent
                    lights (CFLs), and light-emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) use anywhere from 25-80 percent less
                    electricity and last 3 to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs.

                    Although energy efficient bulbs are more expensive off the shelf, their efficient energy use and
                    longer lifetimes mean that they cost less in the long run.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="hh3" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Use smart power strips.
                <p>“Phantom loads,” or the electricity used by electronics when they are turned off or in standby mode,
                    are a major source of energy waste. In fact, it is estimated that 75% of the energy used to power
                    household electronics is consumed when they are switched off, which can cost you up to $200 per
                    year. Smart power strips, also known as advanced power strips, eliminate the problem of phantom
                    loads by shutting off the power to electronics when they are not in use. Smart power strips can be
                    set to turn off at an assigned time, during a period of inactivity, through remote switches, or
                    based on the status of a “master” device</p>

            <div id="hh4" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Install a programmable thermostat
                <p>
                    A programmable thermostat can be set to automatically turn off or reduce heating and cooling during
                    the times when you are asleep or away. When you install a programmable thermostat, you eliminate
                    wasteful energy use from heating and cooling without upgrading your HVAC system.

                    On average, a programmable thermostat can save you $180 per year. Programmable thermostats come in
                    different models that can be set to fit your weekly schedule. Additional features of programmable
                    thermostats can include indicators for when to replace air filters or HVAC system problems, which
                    also improve the efficiency of your heating and cooling system.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="hh5" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Use energy efficient appliances.
                <p>
                    On average, appliances are responsible for roughly 13% of total household energy use. When
                    purchasing an appliance, you should pay attention to two numbers: the initial purchase price and the
                    annual operating cost. Although energy efficient appliances might have higher upfront purchase
                    prices, their operating costs are often 9-25% lower than conventional models.

                    When purchasing an energy efficient appliance, you should look for appliances with the ENERGY STAR
                    label, which is a federal guarantee that the appliance will consume less energy during use and when
                    on standby than standard models. Energy savings differ based on the specific appliance. For example,
                    ENERGY STAR certified clothes washers consume 25% less energy and 45% less water than conventional
                    ones, whereas ENERGY STAR refrigerators use only 9% less energy.

            </div>
            <div id="hh6" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Reduce water heating expenses.
                <p>
                    Water heating is a major contributor to your total energy consumption. Other than purchasing an
                    energy efficient water heater, there are three methods of reducing your water heating expenses: you
                    can simply use less hot water, turn down the thermostat on your water heater, or insulate your water
                    heater and the first six feet of hot and cold water pipes.

                    If you are considering replacing your water heater with an efficient model, you should keep in mind
                    two factors: the type of water heater that meets your needs and the type of fuel it will use. For
                    example, tankless water heaters are energy efficient, but they are also a poor choice for large
                    families as they cannot handle multiple and simultaneous uses of hot water. Efficient water heaters
                    can be anywhere between 8% and 300% more energy efficient than a conventional storage water heater.

            <div id="hh7" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Install energy efficient windows.
                <p>
                    Windows are significant source of energy waste - they can add up to 10-25% of your total heating
                    bill. To prevent heat loss through your windows, you can replace single-pane windows with
                    double-pane products instead.

                    For homes in colder regions, gas-filled windows with “low-e” coatings can significantly reduce your
                    heating expenses. In addition, interior or exterior storm windows can reduce unnecessary heat loss
                    by 10 to 20 percent. You should especially consider storm windows if your region experiences
                    frequent extreme weather events.

                    In warmer climates, heat gain through windows may be a problem. In addition to minimizing heat loss,
                    low-e coatings on windows can reduce heat gain by reflecting more light and lowering the amount of
                    thermal energy that enters your home. Depending on where you live, ENERGY STAR windows can save you
                    $20-$95 each year on your utility bills. Window shades, shutters, screens, and awnings can also
                    provide an extra layer of insulation between your home and outside temperatures, leading to even
                    more energy conservation.

            <div id="hh8" class="save lg6 md12 sm12">Upgrade your HVAC system.
                <p>
                    An HVAC system is composed of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment. Heating alone is
                    responsible for more than 40% of home energy use. Because homes in Northern regions are exposed to
                    much colder temperatures during the year, ENERGY STAR gas furnaces have different specifications in
                    the northern and southern halves of the United States.

                    Upgrading to a “U.S. South” ENERGY STAR certification can save you up to 12% on your heating bill,
                    or an average of $36 per year. ENERGY STAR furnaces in the northern half of the U.S. are labeled
                    with the standard ENERGY STAR logo and are up to 16% more energy efficient than baseline models.
                    This translates to average savings of $94 per year on your heating bill in the Northern U.S.

                    Air conditioning, by comparison, isn’t a significant contributor to energy bills – on average, it
                    only makes up six percent of the total energy use of your home. ENERGY STAR central air conditioning
                    units are eight percent more efficient than conventional models. Air conditioning systems are
                    usually integrated with heating systems, which means that you should purchase your new furnace and
                    air conditioner at the same time in order to ensure that the air conditioner performs at its maximum
                    rated energy efficiency.

                    Upgrades to the third component of an HVAC system – ventilation – can also improve your energy
                    efficiency. A ventilation system is composed of a network of ducts, which distributes hot and cold
                    air throughout your home. If these ducts are not properly sealed or insulated, the resulting energy
                    waste can add hundreds of dollars to your annual heating and cooling expenses. Proper insulation and
                    maintenance on your ventilation system can reduce your heating and cooling expenses by up to 20
                    percent.

                    The most energy efficient way to upgrade your home’s HVAC system is installing air source heat
                    pumps. In order to heat and cool your home, a heat pump transfers heat from one place to another. As
                    a result, air source heat pumps use energy much more efficiently than other technologies and can
                    help with both heating and cooling. In many cases, they offer a smart home energy system upgrade
                    that’s cost and energy efficient.
